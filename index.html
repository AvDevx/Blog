                Why clean design creates better experiences

                    Being pretty self-taught as far as UI design goes, I’ve always wondered why so many articles and books talk about color theory and palettes. In my experience, using a “split complementary palette” is about 0% predictive of me making nice-looking designs.
                    I have another word for that sort of thing: useless.
                    So if color theory doesn’t provide a solid basis for color in UI design, what does?
                    <div class="code"><code>cout<<"Hello world"</code></div>
                    Let me throw an opinion at ya’: color modifications. It’s the tweaking of color that counts, not the picking of them from the color theory hat.
                    Or, said another way: The fundamental skill of coloring interface designs is being able to modify one base color into many different variations.
                    I know this sounds a little odd. Hear me out. I’m going to give you a framework for adjusting color in your UI designs.

                    <h3>Design better and faster</h3>
                    One thing I’ve noticed across many great-looking interfaces is that they often have darker and lighter variations on a particular theme color.
                    You didn’t think that search bar was just a translucent black overlay, did you? Spoiler alert: it’s not. No opacity of black overlaid on that blue will give you the color of the search bar. It’s a variation picked by some other magic.
Quick, now look at Swell Grid, the beautiful surf forecast app.

Sha-BAM. We just got hit with a boatload of variations. How many are there? Go to the website and count ’em yourself. Practically everything on this page is a variation of the initial blue.
Even element states are variations on a color. This isn’t best described as “a palette of 3 blues”. It’s one blue with variations.
But this begs the question: how do you actually modify a color to get good variations?
We’ll get there, but I want you to understand this stuff from the ground-up.
